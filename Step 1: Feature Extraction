We utilize the Sei model to generate high-dimensional sequence embeddings.
Input: sumpeak.txt (Genomic sequences centered on CTCF motifs)
Output: CTCF_118_600bp-hg38_predictions.h5
Run the prediction script:

Bash
python 1_sequence_prediction.py \
    sumpeak.txt \
    /path/to/output_dir/CTCF_118_600bp \
    --genome=hg38 \
    --cuda
Note: Ensure the Sei model weights are correctly downloaded and referenced in the script.
